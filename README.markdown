# Money on Rails

Written: Summer 2007

Money on Rails was my first Rails application and my first real web application. I built it 
to replace an excel spreadsheet for tracking bills and other expenses for my college house. 
We used it full time during my junior year until I wrote [iou-facebook](https://github.com/narced133/iou-facebook)
to replace it.
